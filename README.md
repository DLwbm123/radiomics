# radiomics
Repository with some python scripts to run radiomics analysis
It assumes that you have MITK (http://mitk.org) and Slicer (https://www.slicer.org/) already installed and added to your PATH.
It uses Slicer to convert DICOM images into NRRD format and MITK to run radiomics features extraction (using MitkCLGlobalImageFeatures).
